## Background of Personality Perception
The ***Big Five Personality Traits*** model is based on findings from several independent researchers, and it dates back to the late 1950s. But the model as we know it now began to take shape in the 1990s.
Lewis Goldberg, a researcher at the Oregon Research Institute, is credited with naming the model "*The Big Five*." It is now considered to be an accurate and respected personality scale, which is routinely used by businesses and in psychological research.
